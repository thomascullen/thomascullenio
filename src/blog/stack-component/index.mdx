A lot of design system's out there have built in components for dealing with
layouts. One of the most popular of these is the Stack component. In most cases
a Stack component simply renders a collection of components in a vertical list
adding consistent spacing between them.

```jsx
<Stack spacing="md">
  <AnotherComponent />
  <AnotherComponent />
  <AnotherComponent />
</Stack>
```

Although you can get by without them, I have found that Stack components are
incredibly useful and something I find myself using all the time. They prevent
me having to remember to add the correct padding or margins to each sub
component which keeps the design consistent and the code clean.

```jsx
// Without a Stack component
<>
  <AnotherComponent marginBottom="md" />
  <AnotherComponent marginBottom="md" />
  <AnotherComponent />
</>
```

We are going to use styled-components to build a simple Stack component. First
we'll start by creating the styled components that we are going to need; One for
the root component and another for each child in the stack.

```jsx
import React from "react"
import styled from "styled-components"

export const StyledStack = styled.div``
export const StyledStackItem = styled.div``
```

It's always a good practice to export your styled components incase you need to
use them in styles for other components. Next let's build out the stack component
itself.

```jsx
function Stack({ spacing, children }) {
  return (
    <StyledStack>
      {React.Children.map(children, child => {
        if (!React.isValidElement(child)) {
          return
        }

        return (
          <StyledStackItem spacing={spacing}>
            {React.cloneElement(child)}
          </StyledStackItem>
        )
      })}
    </StyledStack>
  )
}
```

All we are doing here is iterating through each child rendered inside of the
Stack component and wrapping it in the StyledStackItem component passing in the
spacing prop provided to the stack component. Note how we also check if the
child is valid. This allows us to do conditional rendering inside of the Stack
component.

```jsx
<Stack spacing="md">
  <Item />
  {someCondition && <Item />}
  <Item />
</Stack>
```

Finally we need to revisit our styled-components to actually space out the
elements. For the sake of simplicity we are going to define our spacing scale
beside our component, however, I encourage you to integrate this with a theme
specification such as [styled-system](http://styled-system.com). In order to
create the spacing between each element, all we need to do is apply padding to
the top and bottom of each stack item that is half the size of the provided
spacing. Let's update our StyledStackItem component to use the spacing prop.

```jsx
const SPACING = {
  sm: 10,
  md: 20,
  lg: 30,
}

export const StyledStackItem = styled.div`
  padding-top: ${props => SPACING[props.spacing] / 2}px;
  padding-bottom: ${props => SPACING[props.spacing] / 2}px;

  &:first-child {
    padding-top: 0;
  }

  &:last-child {
    padding-bottom: 0;
  }
`
```

We have also removed any top padding from the first element, and any bottom
padding from the last element to prevent any unwanted space around the Stack
component. Finally let's ensure our component is used correctly by using
prop-types to check that a correct spacing key is always passed for the spacing
prop.

```jsx
import PropTypes from "props-types"

// ...

Stack.propTypes = {
  spacing: PropTypes.oneOf(Object.keys(SPACING)),
}
```

And there we have it! A simple Stack component we can use to keep our lists of
elements simple and clean. You can of course take this further and extend it
with additional functionality such as adding a 'divider' prop to render divider
lines between each element in the stack. Another popular case is the ability to
render the stack horizontally, however, I think it is best to create a new
component for this as the requirements are often more complex for horizontal
lists.
