CSS-in-JS libraries are popping up all over the place at the moment. They are a
really powerful way to style apps but how do they actually work?. In this post
we are going to build our own CSS-in-JS library.

Before we dig in it is worth saying that if you are looking for a CSS-in-JS
solution, you should probably use one of the existing libraries out there rather
then building your own as they are well tested with more functionality. Let's
dive in.

We are going to create a simple css-in-js library that follows the 'styled' API
made popular by styled-components. We will only focus on basic functionality so
we won't be looking at things like server side rendering or browser prefixing.
Most CSS-in-JS libraries work by taking style definitions, generating class
names for them and injecting them inside of a style tag in the document head. So
let's start by creating this style tag.

```js
const style = document.createElement("style");
document.head.appendChild(style);
```

We can now attach any CSS rules we want to this style tag using the
CSSStyleSheet `insertRule` method. We can also make use of the `cssRules` method
to ensure we are always adding the rule to the end of the list by providing the
list length as the index we want to insert the rule at.

```js
style.sheet.insertRule(".red { color: red; }", style.sheet.cssRules.length);
```

You can read more about the CSSStyleSheet interface
[here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleSheet).

Next thing we need is a function that will take a CSS rule, generate a
className, insert a new rule into our style tag and return the generated class
name for us to use in our components. For our use case, we can simply using the
index to create a unique class name, instead of doing any kind of hashing like
most libraries do.

```js
function css(styles) {
  const index = style.sheet.cssRules.length;
  const className = `css-${index}`;
  const rule = `.${className} { ${styles} }`;
  style.sheet.insertRule(rule, index);
  return className;
}
```

Now we can use our `css` function to generate class names that we can provide to
our components.

```jsx
function Example() {
  const className = css("color: red;");
  return <div className={className}>This is an example</div>;
}
```

That's great and all but it's far from the API that we want to have. We want to
be able to define components using the popular "styled" API like this.

```js
const Example = styled("div")`
  color: red;
`;
```

In order to achieve this we need to take a quick detour to explore tagged
template literals. First we need to know what a template literal is. A template
literal is a type of string that allows you to interpolate values inside of
them. e.g

```js
const color = "red";
const rule = `color: ${color};`;
```

A tagged template literal is a special way of parsing a template literal with a
function. This function will be called with an array of all of the string parts
as well as any variables provided.

```js
function greet(strings, ...args) {
  console.log("strings: ", strings);
  console.log("args: ", args);
}

const name = "Thomas";
greet`My name is ${name}!`;
// strings: ["My name is", "!"]
// args: ["Thomas"]
```

Now that we know a template literal can be tagged with a function, we can
revisit out css-in-js implementation to achieve the API we want. We need to
create a `styled` function that takes the type of dom element we want to render
and returns a function that we can then use as a tagged template literal to
create our react component. Let's keep things simple to start with and just take
the styles that we pass in as is so that we can focus on getting the API we
want.

```js
function styled(tag) {
  return function styledTemplate(rules) {
    return function Component(props) {
      // remember that tagged template literals give us the string parts as an
      // array so for now we just pass the first element of the array which will
      // be the entire CSS rule because we aren't passing any variables.
      const className = css(rules[0]);
      return React.createElement(tag, { className, ...props });
    };
  };
}
```

ðŸ˜¦ I know, that's a lot of functions returning functions. Let's walk through it.
The `styled` function returns the `styledTemplate` function. The
`styledTemplate` function is similar to our `greet` function from earlier. We
call it as a tagged template literal. This then returns the react component
which we can render. So with all of this in place we can do do the following.

```jsx
const Header = styled("h1")`
  font-size: 24px;
  font-weight: 600;
`

<Header>This is a header</Header>
```

So this is finaly starting to look like the styled-components API we wanted. But
what about things like adapting styles based on component props? Let's say we
wanted our Header component to change color based on a `color` prop as well as
allowing the background-color to be customized with a `bg` prop. For that we
need to revisit how we are treating the tagged template literal. Remember how
our `greet` function was given a second array of all of the variables passed
into the template literal? Well we can also pass functions into the template
literal, which we can then call will out component props at render time. ðŸ¤¯
Let's create a new function that will process the string literal and any
functions we provide it into a single CSS rule.

```jsx
function resolveRule(parts, args, props) {
  return parts.reduce((output, part, index) => {
    if (index === rules.length - 1) {
      return output + part;
    }
    return output + part + args[index](props);
  });
}
```

With this function we only have one thing left to do which is to update our
`styled` function to make use of it.

```js
function styled(tag) {
  return function styledTemplate(rules, ...args) {
    return function Component(props) {
      const resolved = resolveRule(rules, args, props);
      const className = css(resolved);
      return React.createElement(tag, { className, ...props });
    };
  };
}
```

And there we have it! Our very own CSS-in-JS library.

```jsx
const Header = styled("h1")`
  font-size: 24px;
  font-weight: 600;
  color: ${(props) => props.color || "black"};
  background-color: ${(props) => props.bg || "transparent"};
`;
```
