React.memo is a higher order component that react provides out of the box that can be
used to increase the performance of your components. But what exactly does it do?
By default React.memo takes a React function component and memoizes the result so that
it will skip rendering and resuse the last render unless the props change.

Let's look at the following code...

```jsx
import React from "react"

function Hello() {
  console.log("Hello rendered")
  return <p>Hello World</p>
}

function App() {
  console.log("App rendered")
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(1)

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Count {count}</h1>
      <Hello />
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Trigger App render</button>
    </>
  )
}

export default App
```

<Example01 />

If you open the web console you will notice in the example above that every time we render the App
component, we also render the Test component. Now watch what happens when we wrap the Test
component with React.memo...

```jsx
import React from "react"

const Hello = React.memo(function Hello() {
  console.log("Hello rendered")
  return <p>Hello World</p>
})

function App() {
  console.log("App rendered")
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(1)

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Count {count}</h1>
      <Hello />
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Trigger App render</button>
    </>
  )
}

export default App
```

<Example02 />

Now every time we cause the App component to render, the Hello component does not render again.
This is becuase React.memo has reused the last render of the Test component because we have not
provided it any new props.

## What if we need more control over when a component should re-render?

React.memo allows us to customize the logic for determining when a component should
re-render by passing it a function as a second argument. By default react will do a shallow comparison of all
of the component props. This is the equivilant of using the === operator against every previous
value for each prop. Let's say we have an Avatar component which takes two props; a size which is
a string and a user object which we will use to get the avatar URL.

```jsx
<Avatar size="lg" user={{ name: "Thomas", avatar: "https://..." }} />
```

Even if we wrap this component with React.memo, it will re render every time because of
how javascript compares objects. e.g

```js
const userA = { name: "Thomas", avatar: "https://..." }
const userB = { name: "Thomas", avatar: "https://..." }
userA === userB // false
userA === userA // true
```

In order to get React.memo to work we need to tell it how to compare new props to the
previous props by passing a function as a second paramter.

```jsx
import React from "react"

function userIsEqual(prev, next) {
  if (prev.size !== next.size) return false
  return prev.name === next.name && prev.avatar === next.avatar
}

const Avatar = React.memo(function Avatar({ user }) {
  return <div>Avatar</div>
}, userIsEqual)

export default Avatar
```

I find that its generally best to avoid doing this as it is prone to introducing bugs if you forget
to update your comparison function. Most of the time a better approach is to rely on the built in
shallow comparison that React.memo provides and use memoized props and callback functions instead.

## Memoized props and callback functions

As we have already seen, in javascript objects are only equal to themselves. We face the same
problem when using arrays and functions.

```js
const optionsA = ["Yellow", "Red", "Blue"]
const optionsB = ["Yellow", "Red", "Blue"]
optionsA === optionsB // false
```

When we pass an array as a prop to a component wrapped with React.memo we have to think about
wether or not we are passing the same instance of that array or a new one. Instead of using a
custom comparison function, we can use memoized props to get React.memo working. Lets look at
a common example.

```jsx
const Select = React.memo(function Select({ options, ...props }) {
  return (
    <select {...props}>
      {options.map(option => (
        <option key={option}>{option}</option>
      ))}
    </select>
  )
})

function ColorSelect({ data }) {
  const options = data.colors.map(c => c.name)
  return <Select options={options} />
}
```

Here we have a Select component wrapped in React.memo that takes an array of strings and renders
them as options in a select dropdown. The ColorSelect component then takes a data prop (usually
returned from an API) and converts that into an array of strings for the Select component. Even
though we have wrapped Select with React.memo, it will have no effect as we are passing a new
instance of 'options' everytime ColorSelect is rendered. We can fix this using the `useMemo`
hook inside the ColorSelect component.

```jsx
const Select = React.memo(function Select({ options, ...props }) {
  return (
    <select {...props}>
      {options.map(option => (
        <option key={option}>{option}</option>
      ))}
    </select>
  )
})

function ColorSelect({ data }) {
  const options = React.useMemo(() => data.colors.map(c => c.name), [])
  return <Select options={options} />
}
```

Now everytime ColorSelect is rendered, it will use the same instance of options as before thanks
to the useMemo hook. But what about functions? We are also going to want to pass an `onChange`
prop to our Select component.

```jsx
const Select = React.memo(function Select({ options, ...props }) {
  return (
    <select {...props}>
      {options.map(option => (
        <option key={option}>{option}</option>
      ))}
    </select>
  )
})

function ColorSelect({ data }) {
  const options = React.useMemo(() => data.colors.map(c => c.name), [])

  const handleChange = e => {
    console.log("changed")
  }

  return <Select options={options} onChange={handleChange} />
}
```

Now we have the same problem as before. Everytime the ColorSelect component renders, we are
passing a new instance of handleChange to the Select component. Once again, React provides a
hook we can use to fix this. We can use the `useCallback` hook to memoize the handleChange
function.

```jsx
const Select = React.memo(function Select({ options, ...props }) {
  return (
    <select {...props}>
      {options.map(option => (
        <option key={option}>{option}</option>
      ))}
    </select>
  )
})

function ColorSelect({ data }) {
  const options = React.useMemo(() => data.colors.map(c => c.name), [])

  const handleChange = React.useCallback(e => {
    console.log("changed")
  }, [])

  return <Select options={options} onChange={handleChange} />
}
```

The useMemo and useCallback hooks are powerful but can lead to bugs if you don't provide
them the correct dependencies. It is worth reading through the React documentation for both
of these hooks to fully understand them before relying on them. Sometimes you might need to
pass a new instance every time and thats ok!

## So when should we use React.memo?

If you have a large component that always renders the same result when given the same props
then you could benefit from wrapping it with React.memo. However, it is important to bare in mind
that if you are passing complex props like objects, arrays and functions, you may need to memoize
those props using the useMemo and useCallback hooks first.
